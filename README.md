## 🌐 Data Sientist | Data/BI Analyst

Data Scientist and BI Analyst with over 4 years of experience in ETL, data modeling, dashboard development, and predictive analytics. Currently working as a Data and Process Analyst at Tecla T/Hapvida, where I lead and support educational and innovation projects by applying data-driven methodologies to optimize processes and decision-making.

I have strong expertise in Power BI (DAX, modeling, advanced visualizations), SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS-SQL, HIVE), Python/R, and agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban). My experience includes process automation, data pipeline development, and system integration, ensuring reliable and accessible information across different business units.

My work also covers query optimization for large-scale datasets and experience with Spark, Hadoop, HDFS, and Databricks. I focus on monitoring data quality, identifying inconsistencies, and designing improvements, in addition to developing statistical and predictive models that support strategic decisions.
